<b>Rich features based on the vocabulary you learned in Duolingo!</b>

Duo Tracker syncs with the vocabulary you've learned in Duolingo to provide you with a variety of features. In addition, Duo Tracker is designed to give you intuitive and easy access to information that is not easily accessible in Duolingo.
